Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by! I'm an Instructional Specialist at 2U's Data-Analytics bootcamp. Our team is committed to unlocking human potential and solving societal needs through providing high-quality digital education.If this resonates with you, we are actively hiring (full + part time)!

As a software engineer, my main areas of interest lie in web development and machine learning. I have a year of experience developing web applications with MVC and N-Layer architectures, employing a robust toolkit including but not limited to C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, Azure CI/CD, HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. I'm adept at Git for source control and have hands-on experience with RESTful API via ASP.NET Web API. Recently, I've been augmenting my skills in Angular, focusing on the intricate dynamics of routing, services, lifecycle hooks, observables, and subscriptions. I am open to new opportunities that leverage and further develop my skillset!

Beyond software engineering, my expertise extends to data analytics, particularly using Python and R. I've built comprehensive pipelines, employing libraries like Pandas and SciPy for data manipulation and AstroPy for astronomical computations. I'm skilled in every step of data analysis: extraction, validation using custom-built scripts, storage in SQL databases, and in-depth analysis using machine learning techniques. I've conducted multivariate analyses, generating visuals with Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide clear, actionable insights.

Outside of professional pursuits, I enjoy coding challenges, calisthenics, and day-trading. I was also born and raised in Mongolia and speak fluent Mongolian.
